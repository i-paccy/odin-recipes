    <p> 
        American lasagna is a hearty, comforting dish that typically features layers of wide pasta,
        a rich meat-based tomato sauce, and generous amounts of cheese, 
        often including ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan. Unlike traditional Italian lasagna, 
        which uses lighter sauces like marinara or béchamel, 
        American lasagna often incorporates ground beef, 
        sausage, or pork in the sauce for added flavor and richness. 
        The dish is baked until bubbly and golden, and it's known for its thick, 
        cheesy layers and large, filling portions. While variations exist, 
        such as vegetarian versions with spinach or mushrooms, American lasagna is usually a more indulgent, 
        cheese-heavy version of the classic Italian recipe, making it a favorite for family meals and gatherings.
