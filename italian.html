        <p> 
            Chef John’s Italian Meatballs are a flavorful, tender, and juicy take on traditional Italian meatballs, often made with a combination of ground beef and pork, along with a mix of seasonings and fresh herbs. The recipe typically involves combining the meats with breadcrumbs, Parmesan cheese, garlic, eggs, and parsley to create a moist and flavorful mixture. The meatballs are then gently browned in a skillet before being simmered in marinara sauce to absorb all the rich, savory flavors. Chef John often emphasizes the importance of not overworking the meat mixture to keep the meatballs tender and moist. They’re often served with pasta or as a sub sandwich, and are praised for their perfect balance of seasoning and texture. You can find Chef John’s version on Food Wishes, his popular YouTube channel.
