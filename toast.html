    <p> 
        Fluffy French toast is a delicious, light breakfast made by dipping thick slices of bread (like brioche or challah) into a mixture of beaten eggs, milk, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and a pinch of salt, then cooking them in a buttery skillet until golden brown and fluffy. The result is a soft, airy texture with a lightly crisp exterior, perfect for serving with toppings like maple syrup, powdered sugar, and fresh fruit. It's an indulgent treat that's easy to make and perfect for a cozy morning meal.

    <h2> Ingredients </h2>

    <ul>
        <li> Flour: This fluffy French toast batter starts with ¼ cup all-purpose flour </li>
        <li> Milk: Milk adds moisture and richness to the batter. You can substitute half-and-half, cream, or your favorite alternative milk if you like. </li>
        <li> Eggs: Of course, you’ll need eggs for French toast! Three eggs bind the batter together and give it a rich texture. </li>
        <li> Sugar: A tablespoon of white sugar lends welcome sweetness to this decadent breakfast recipe. </li>
        <li>Vanilla: A teaspoon of vanilla extract adds complexity and takes the flavor up a notch </li>
        <li> Cinnamon: Ground cinnamon lends coziness and warmth. </li>
        <li> Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won’t make your French toast taste salty. </li>
        <li> Bread: You’ll need 12 slices of your favorite thick-sliced bread. Good choices include brioche, sourdough, French bread, or challah. </li>
    </ul>

    <h> STEPS </h>

        <ol>
            <li> In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, vanilla extract, cinnamon (if using), and salt. Whisk until the mixture is fully combined and slightly frothy. </li>
            <li> Place a large skillet or griddle over medium heat. Add a tablespoon of butter and let it melt, swirling it to coat the bottom of the pan. </li>
            <li> Dip a slice of bread into the egg mixture, making sure it’s fully soaked but not soggy. Let any excess drip off before placing it in the hot skillet. </li>
            <li> Place the soaked bread slice in the skillet and cook for 2-4 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and fluffy. You can adjust the heat slightly if the bread is browning too quickly. </li>
        </ol>
